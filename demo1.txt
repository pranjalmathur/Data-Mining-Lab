generate dataset:


Create 5(n) buckets for 5(n) items
Frequency paramemter: frequency of all the items across all the buckets.
zipf factor - 0.99 (high a , low e)(skewed)
0.1 means same frequency for all items set (uniform)
skew towards the first item - 0.99 (a is more)


(table)
item ---------------------- frequency (table)



Genenerate - random number for items in a transaction (eg: 3-7)
select random items for every transaction

DEMO:
ZIPF distribution: for frequency of items 
Start with 10 or 5 items.
Actual demo with 100 to 500 items???
Transaction ~ 10000
use zipf =0.5

Give a default 

Give main memory statistics

Give execution time (in apt format)

assn -(total no. of items) -(support)

itemset-------------------support(about 50)-average support
